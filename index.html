    <p>Hi, welcome to my summer 2025 travel list! This summer it is my goal to travel to both coasts of the U.S. As a customer service agent at an airlines, my work benefits are discounted flights, making travel a lot more affordable. I would love to travel internationally, however, I do not have my passport and so I decided to visit possible cities I would love to move into after completing my degree! So far this year I have travelled to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seattle</li>
      <li>Oklahoma</li>
      <li>Dallas, Texas</li>
      <li>Chicago</li>
    </ul>
